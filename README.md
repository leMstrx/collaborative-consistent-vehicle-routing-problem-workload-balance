# collaborative-consistent-vehicle-routing-problem-workload-balance
### Introduction 🚗: 
This repository addresses the Collaborative Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem (CCVRP) with a focus on achieving optimal workload balance among multiple vehicles. 

## Code: 
- Main.py       -> all the optimization and plotting done here
- data.py       -> all the data in one place also cost function and duration calculation etc.
- carrier_x.py  -> carrierspecific data to calculate the profits without collaboration
- nocolab.py    -> calculate the profits for each carrier

### Implementation 🛠️:
The core of the project is implemented in [programming language] and leverages [optimization library or algorithm] for efficient solution generation. Detailed documentation is provided to assist users and collaborators in understanding the codebase and integrating it into their projects.
