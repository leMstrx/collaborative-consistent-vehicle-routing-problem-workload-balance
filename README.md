## Code: 
- Main.py       -> all the optimization and plotting done here
- data.py       -> all the data in one place also cost function and duration calculation etc.
- carrier_x.py  -> carrierspecific data to calculate the profits without collaboration
- nocolab.py    -> calculate the profits for each carrier

### Implementation 🛠️:
The core of the project is implemented in python and leverages gurobi for efficient solution generation. Detailed documentation is provided to assist users and collaborators in understanding the codebase and integrating it into their projects.
